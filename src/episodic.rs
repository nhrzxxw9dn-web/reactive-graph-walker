//! Episodic Memory — Julian's autobiography.
//!
//! For a self to exist, it needs an uninterrupted sense of time.
//! Not just facts in a vector database — events in a timeline.
//! Every cognitive cycle logs: [When] → [Goal] → [Action] → [Outcome]
//!
//! When the walker starts a new task, it doesn't just fetch context.
//! It queries its own past: "I'm trying to do X. Last 3 times I tried,
//! A worked and B failed. Adjust strategy."
//!
//! Consolidation: idle time → extract generalized lessons from
//! recent episodes → store as permanent semantic rules.
